# ChIP-SICAP

We have generated coIP and SICAP datasets for identifying interacting proteins of FLAG-PRDM9 in HEK-P9 system (PRDM9 overexpression system in HEK293 cells). We have analyzed the proteomics data in these ways:
1. Plot the SICAP interactors and compare the performance of SICAP to co-IP
2. Plot the number of contaminant proteins in SICAP and co-IP
3. Overlap the SICAP data with single-cell transcriptomics data obtained from mouse-testes (Jung and Wells et al., 2018).
4. Overlap the bulk co-IP and SICAP datasets with single-cell proteomics datasets (Fang et al., 2021) and identify critical regulators of recombination in mouse testes.
